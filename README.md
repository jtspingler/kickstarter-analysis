# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Using pivot tables and graphs Excel to visualize campaign outcomes ("successful," "failed," and "canceled") based on launch date from the Kickstarter data set provided.
### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to identify trends of multiple campaigns based on factors such as funding goals and launch dates. 
## Analysis and Challenges
This data was relatively clean at first. In order to identify date trends, we converted the timestamps to dates as well as then extracting the year and month from this date.

I struggled with grouping the Months as their names rather than the numberical representation.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
